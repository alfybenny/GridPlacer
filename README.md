# GridPlacer
A **Blender Addon** to generate surface plots from user provided data

## Installation
- Download the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfybenny/GridPlacer.git
```
- Extract the `.zip` file 
- Go to preferences in Blender (Edit > Preferences)
- Click on install (One of the top right buttons)
- Go to the extracted folder and select `GridPlacer.py`
- Don't forget to activate the installed Addon (activate the checkmark)

## Usage
- Create a blender file and save it
- Make sure you have a file named `data.txt` in the same folder as the blender file
- `data.txt` should have a 2D grid (Matrix) data of your dezired surface
- Click on the `Simple Object Operator' under `Layout Demo` in the `Scene Properties` section (Sorry for the generic names, will replace with some humane names later)
- A 3D surface of your data should appear in the view

## Planned updates
- Automatic axis support
- Add color schemes
